# Test Trees

# testTree14
This has some inputs and outputs that are named.  The test has a reused blackboard that can fail at certain calls.


# testTree14a
Same as 14 however outOnlyD has 3 outputs.

# testTree14a
Same as 14 however I hand edited the XML to be malformed 'inOnlyA' is missing from the xml <TreeNodesModel>.


# testTree16
Uses unnamed output ports (aka `_in_0`).


# testTree16a
Same as 16 however one of the output ports is a string instead of a proper variable
